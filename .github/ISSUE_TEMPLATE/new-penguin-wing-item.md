**How should the wing-item look?**
Describe what kind of wing-item you want.

**Should it look differently, depending on the wing it is in?**
Additionally: is there some special interaction necessary or desired (e.g., if another gadget is selected or certain clothes are displayed).

**Is there already a similar wing-item?**
In that case, we might not need a completely new extra but just add some options to an existing one.

**Additional context**
